        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <p>Book Club opened in July 2020 and serves as a community hub of the Upper West Side: a new kind of independent bookstore featuring top-notch coffee, wine, and gin. This spirited and dynamic neighborhood is reflected in the store: from the cozy
            living room-feel decor, to curated book inventory, locally roasted coffee, and NY state wine. Come hang out with us!</p>

                            or online. Your purchase will include a ticket that will admit you into the signing line at the event. By purchasing a book from Parnassus, you are not only supporting a locally owned, independent business, but you are also
                            showing publishers that they should continue sending authors to Parnassus. Think about it this way: You wouldn't bring your own biscuits to the Loveless Cafe, would you?</td>
